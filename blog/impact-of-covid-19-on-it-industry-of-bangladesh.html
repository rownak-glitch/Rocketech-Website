                <div class="blog_page_info">
                    <p class="mt-4">As the global economy is facing the ‘Great lockdown’ recession caused by the
                        COVID-19 pandemic, the economy of Bangladesh too has been hit hard. With only 15% of the
                        country’s population making more than USD 6 per day, Bangladesh stands in a vulnerable position
                        to tackle the economic impact of COVID-19. One of the sectors that have taken the impact both
                        positively and negatively is the IT Industry (Information Technology Industry).</p>

                    <h5>Overview of Bangladesh’s ICT Industry </h5>

                    <p>Bangladesh has been working steadily to set up "Computerized Bangladesh", an indispensable piece
                        of the administration's Vision 2021. IT organizations in Bangladesh began sending out
                        programming around two decades prior, joining the business procedure redistributing (BPO)
                        fleeting trend. Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), which began
                        its excursion with 17 organizations in 1997, presently remains at 1200+ organizations engaged
                        with programming improvement and giving IT administrations. ICT sent out by 250+ organizations,
                        in 60+ nations around the globe, represented USD 800 Million in which was 2.2 percent of the
                        all-out fare esteem. According to USAID, North America is the nation's primary fare goal. </p>

                    <p>Bangladeshi IT and ITES firms produce practically 35% of its fare income from US purchasers, 15%
                        from the UK, trailed by various EU nations, for example, Denmark and the Netherlands. Various
                        neighborhood endeavors likewise trade IT-ITES administrations to UAE, Saudi Arabia, South
                        Africa, Malaysia, and Singapore. This is the difficult work of the 1 Million individuals who are
                        working legitimately in the ICT business. The administration had set a fare focus of all-out USD
                        5 Billion by 2021.</p>


                    <p>The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) exports by 250 plus companies, to 60 plus
                        countries around the world, accounted for $800 million in 2017, which was 2.2 percent of the
                        country's total export value. According to USAID, North America is Bangladesh's main export
                        destination.</p>


                    <h5>E-Commerce & E-Service </h5>

                    <p>Likewise, during the late '90s, the online business industry began its excursion in Bangladesh,
                        be that as it may, didn't observe any development up until the most recent decade. The
                        improvement of banking offices coordinations correspondence and electronic installment
                        strategies has made open doors for the internet business division of Bangladesh to develop. Over
                        the previous years, the nation's shopping conduct has moved drastically with the adjustment in
                        the expectation for everyday comforts of the populace. The developing populace is presently
                        progressively familiar with making exchanges of items and administrations on the web. </p>

                    <p>Starting in 2019, as per an exploration firm, distributed in Bangladesh every day], the web-based
                        business market of Bangladesh is expressed to be USD 1.6 billion and is relied upon to twofold
                        to USD 3 billion constantly by 2023. Bangladesh's administration forced a 7.5 percent VAT on
                        this part may unfavorably influence the progressing digitization plan of the legislature and
                        hamper the work rate in this division as indicated by industry insiders. As far as income from
                        web-based business, Bangladesh positioned 46th position internationally. Developing cell phone
                        entrance and notoriety of 4G arrays alongside the expanding buying intensity of buyers are
                        driving the internet business industry over the world including this south Asian nation,
                        Bangladesh. With the approach of COVID-19, the online business industry is seeing an unnatural
                        upsurge all-inclusive and with the world heading into an inescapable worldwide downturn, the
                        development of the business will undoubtedly back off.</p>


                    <h5>Covid-19 on IT Industry </h5>

                    <p>Covid-19 possesses a unique challenge for the IT industry of Bangladesh as it is only in the
                        growth stage now. Industry insiders expect the overall revenue for the 2020 year to fall by
                        20-25 percent due to the pandemic. Companies that deal with the BPO of medical and legislative
                        data for North American companies – such as Therapy, Augmedix – are somewhat stable in their
                        business now, given the heightened respiration of the medical industry.</p>


                    <h5>Challenges</h5>

                    <p>The COVID-19 effect has a special test for the IT business as it is just in its development stage
                        in Bangladesh. Industry insiders expect the general income for the multi-year to diminish by
                        20-25 percent because of the pandemic. Organizations that manage BPO of clinical and
                        administrative information for North American organizations, for example, Therapy, Augmedix are
                        to some degree stable as far as their business is given the increased breadth of the clinical
                        business. Nonetheless, the industry players that principally center around redistributing or
                        programming improvement, are off guard. India serves 16 percent of the worldwide market and
                        they're as of now foreseeing a lower development rate than the recently evaluated 7.5 percent
                        during the current year (Nasscom).</p>


                    <p>Despite the fact that the business actually has the ability to work remotely by its temperament,
                        the effect of the pandemic is as yet felt due to faltering business orders from end customers.
                        Since Bangladesh ICT send out is essentially reliant on business from North American and
                        European organizations, there has been a general fall in re-appropriating given the spread of
                        the infection in these locales. As most worldwide tech organizations are presently covered with
                        representatives telecommuting, the effect of business development has deteriorated and the wave
                        has been felt in the neighborhood redistributing industry. Other than a couple of huge tech
                        organizations in Bangladesh, most organizations don't work on a retainer premise and are subject
                        to extending the premise business age. Because of the abrogation or delaying of activities in
                        such a surprising occasion, business congruence is in a difficult situation, bringing about
                        neighborhood organizations confronting money crunches. This is material in any event for those
                        that don't have a power majeure arrangement in their agreements than works in support of them.
                    </p>


                    <p>However, the industry players that mainly focus on outsourcing of software development are at a
                        disadvantage. India, for example, serves 16 percent of the global market and is already
                        predicting a lower growth rate than the previously estimated 7.5 percent for this year, says the
                        Indian IT industry body Nasscom. Although the industry can operate remotely by its nature, the
                        impact of the pandemic is still felt due to stuttering business orders from the end clients.
                        Since Bangladesh's ICT export is mainly dependent on businesses of North American and European
                        companies, there has been a general fall in outsourcing given the spread of Covid-19 in these
                        regions. </p>


                    <h5>Maintaining Cash Flow </h5>

                    <p>Software organizations that serve the neighborhood advertise generally are confronting more
                        difficulties contrasted with those that are centered more around re-appropriating. Because of
                        the monetary end, neighborhood customers are slowing down installment prompting income
                        challenges for these organizations. Organizations in North American and Europe are sourcing
                        locally for the present, particularly on security observing, catastrophe recuperation and so on
                        as conveyance of work from seaward administrations, particularly China has gone to a dramatic
                        end. Kabir, Co-Founder, and CEO of BrainStation-23 say that there's likewise potential here for
                        development – if organizations are spry and are eager to turn quick. As indicated by him, video
                        spilling, AI, and web-based learning are solid business vertices to investigate now. They have
                        seen a solid upsurge popular for Moodle, an open-source Learning Platform or course the board
                        framework (CMS), from customers in the instruction segment because of the abrupt increment in
                        online study halls. Government contracts where outside governments are looking for programming
                        arrangements comparable to the pandemic emergency are likewise a potential objective development
                        zone for the business.</p>


                    <h5>WFH for IT Company Employees </h5>


                    <p>Cutbacks are yet to occur in the business yet littler organizations with constrained incomes may
                        need to depend on pay slices to endure if the pandemic perseveres long haul. On a smaller scale
                        level, since tech organizations work on a dexterous procedure of conveying work in a
                        foreordained deliverable calendar, responsibility because of remote work has disturbed the
                        conveyance cycles. Als0, most organizations are having issues with remote work as misfortune and
                        conveyance of information over unprotected web associations is a major test. Enormous
                        organizations work through their own secured servers and frameworks in their office and
                        information sharing and affirmation of insurance of said information on an open framework is a
                        major test for most. In India, a few organizations have started introducing corporate
                        workstations at their representative homes yet this is difficult to continue and execute on an
                        industry-wide scale. Another fundamental test detailed by the business is the absence of web
                        transfer speed while working from home. Because of the abrupt upsurge of interest for home web
                        utilization, the foundation is stressed and its effect is likewise felt in the IT business. The
                        main silver covering in such an inauspicious circumstance is, that re-appropriated
                        administration work areas are supporting immense volumes of end-clients attempting to get to
                        frameworks remotely however it additionally accompanies the test of architects encouraging
                        overpowering interest frequently with innovation stacks with which they have no preparation or
                        commonality.</p>


                    <h5>Positive Impacts by Covid-19 on IT Industry </h5>

                    <p>In a period, for example, this, the web-based business and e-administration industry is likewise
                        confronting comparative difficulties. At first, with the greater part of the urban Dhaka
                        populace put into segregation and following social separation, the number of online buys in the
                        B2C internet business stages (daraz.com, Pathao, chaldal.com, and so on) confronted an unnatural
                        spike. Notwithstanding, food conveyance administrations have seen a sharp downturn in only the
                        previous week with orders falling by 75 to 80 percent as indicated by an industry agent from
                        Shohoz. Subsequently, 40 to 50 percent of eateries have additionally shut down prompting the
                        fall in business. According to a BRTA mandate, ridesharing by Uber and Pathao has been
                        restricted to confine the spread of COVID-19. The interest in influenza-related items, for
                        example, cleaning operators and solid enhancements are high. Be that as it may, because of the
                        lack of provisions inferable from the pandemic, the constrained items are valued at a higher
                        range. Conveyance of e-administrations has additionally gone to an end because of the usage of
                        the isolate. Chaldal has seen an expansion in online staple conveyance requests and alongside
                        other food conveyance administrations have imitated the contactless conveyance framework. Online
                        supermarkets are encountering twofold digit developments in the number of conveyances with
                        Chaldal's normal 5000 requests for every day bouncing to 10,000 to 15,000 requests for each day
                        on a normal. The computerized e-wellbeing administration industry is confronting an unexpected
                        flood incall meeting with Telenor Health detailing a 30 percent expansion in telephone interview
                        services. Similarly, Praava Health has propelled a minimal effort video counsel administrations
                        to handle the upsurge in social insurance exhortation requests. Since the e-administrations and
                        internet business industry is exceptionally reliant on day-wage/legally</p>



                    <h5>Measures that Should be Taken</h5>

                    <p>With the difficulties now obvious for the IT and advanced segment, the legislature must give
                        critical consideration to its third-motor in a post-coronavirus Bangladesh. On a B2C level,
                        e-administration organizations, for example, food conveyance and ridesharing ones need to make a
                        sheltered and clean condition in their activities by guaranteeing that all the conveyance men,
                        riders and drivers play it safe truly. On a B2B level, tech organizations need to help their
                        staff by giving legitimate work from home activities and making responsibility through better
                        administration and conveyance methods. The organizations likewise need to promise their
                        customers that the work from home won't sway business fundamentally and prudent steps are being
                        taken to guarantee business congruity. The coronavirus stands to clear out 1.1 percent of
                        Bangladesh's total national output, bringing about 894,930 employments being lost according to a
                        projection of the Asian Development Bank. Almost certainly, the IT and computerized industry
                        will fall into this mash alongside the readymade article of the clothing industry. Also, for
                        long haul development affirmation, arrangements ought to be made for the business as of late
                        looking for $1 billion in help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank by the
                        legislature. As a matter of fact, it will be difficult to not feel the effect of the pandemic in
                        any industry yet preparatory and steady arrangements will guarantee that the tech and
                        computerized industry won't be injured in a post-COVID-19 economy.</p>
